I built this project to get more practice with <b>React</b> and <b>React Styled Components</b>.

# Overview

## The challenge

### Users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
  - [x] <b>Mobile</b> @ 375px
  - [x] <b>Tablet</b> @ 768px
  - [x] <b>Desktop</b> @ 1275px
- [x] See <b>hover</b> states for all interactive elements throughout the site
  - [x] <b>Button</b> `background-color` and `transform` updates on <b>hover</b>
  - [x] <b>Links</b> `color` updates on <b>hover</b>

## My process

### Built with

- <b>[React](https://reactjs.org/)</b> - JavaScript Framework
- <b>[React Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)</b> - For styles
- Semantic <b>HTML5</b> markup
- <b>Sass</b> 
  - <b>CSS</b> custom properties
  - <b>Flexbox</b>
- <b>Mobile-first workflow</b>
  - <b>Mobile</b> breakpoint @ 375px
  - <b>Tablet</b> beakpoint @ 768px
  - <b>Desktop</b> breakpoint @ 1275px
 
### What I learned

- The main motivation for completing this project was to get more practice with [React Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).  I feel very comfortable with [React Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) at this point, it's a great way to organize <b>CSS</b> styling within <b>React</b>.

- An <b>interesting snippet</b> of code from this project is the code that I used to <b>dynamically render</b> the `<Card/>`content. In Mobile view the `image` within the `<Card/>` is rendered on the top and the `text` is rendered underneath. <i>BUT</i> on the <b>Desktop</b> view the `image` and the `text` are rendered on the same line, and alternate left/right positions within each `<Card/>` 
  - So in `Card.styled.js` I used 

  ````
  @media (min-width: ${({ theme }) => theme.tablet}) {
      flex-direction: ${({ layout }) => layout || "row-reverse"};
      ...
  }
  ````
  - and in `<Card/>` I alternated the `flex-direction` based on the card `id` using

  ````
  <StyledCard layout={id % 2 === 0 && "row"}>
  ````
  - To get this

## Continued development

- [ ] Add <b>components</b> for all of the <b>links</b>
  - [ ] `<TryPage/>` which would link from the<b>"Try for Free"</b> and <b>"Get Started for free"</b> buttons
  - [ ] `<About/>` which would link from the<b>About</b> link in the footer
  - [ ] `<WhatWeDo/>` which would link from the <b>What We Do</b> link in the footer
  - [ ] `<FAQ/>` which would link from the <b>FAQ</b> link in the footer
  - [ ] `<Career/>` which would link from the <b>Career</b> link in the footer
  - [ ] `<Blog/>` which would link from the <b>Blog</b> link in the footer
  - [ ] `<Contact/>` which would link from the <b>Contact</b> link in the footer
- [ ] Use <b>Jest</b> testing framework to add a few tests for the <b>React</b> code
