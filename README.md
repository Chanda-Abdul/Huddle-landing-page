### What I learned

- The main motivation for completing this project was to get more pracgice with RSC.  I feel very comfortable with RSC now.

- An interesting snippet of code from this project is
I dynamically rendered the card content. but on the desktop the image and the text would alternate positions with each card. So in `Card.styled.js`
I used 
````
@media (min-width: ${({ theme }) => theme.tablet}) {
    flex-direction: ${({ layout }) => layout || "row-reverse"};
    ...
}
````
and in <Card/> alternated ` flex-direction` based on the card `id`
````
 <StyledCard layout={id % 2 === 0 && "row"}>
````
 To get this
<img src="./design/card.png" alt="" width="300"/>
